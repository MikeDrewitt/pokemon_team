# Pokemon Team Builder

This is a Pokemon team management application. It allows the user, once they have a Team
selected to view different statistics about the team that they've put together as well as choose
available moves for each Pokemon, etc. 

# Getting started

Assuming that you have npm/ yarn installed this should be very easy (hopefully)!

run

```npm install```

to install all project dependancies. Then run

``` npm start ```

to run the local development server. It should be located at localhost:8000
